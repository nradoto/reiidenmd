
 AddIntroGen - program adds in Rom Sega Mega Drive your own intro.

 In one Rom possible to insert several intros! For each intro can
 edit palette. Each image can be 16 (1 transparent + 15) colors.
 Button Start - switching intro.

 How it works:
  
    MAIN MENU:

 1. "Open Rom": format *.gen or *.bin
 2. "Insert Intro": insert the default logo screen. Afterwards you can
    change logo (use any graphics editor for graphics Sega Mega Drive and
    Default_logo.bin).
 3. "Intro pointer": This field shows the pointer to our intro.
 4. "Insert intro pointer": inserts a new pointer to the Rom.
 5. Performing with 1st through 4th paragraphs, we insert in Rom default intro. At this stage
    You can check the Rom (running Rom in the emulator). Once you have verified that the rom
    works, you can insert your logo. This can be done editing the file
    Default_logo.bin in any editor for graphics Sega Mega Drive, and insert it then in Rom.
    Use the button "Own picture."

    PALETTE:

 1. Button "Reload" and "Save", respectively, to load and save Rom palette.
    Double-click on the cell with color opens choice of the colour. If you hold
    the cursormouse over a cell with the color, a hint will be displayed color (format RGB).
 2. The "Palette address": palette address in Rom.
 3. Use the "Import palette from file" and "Export palette to file" can be imported and
    export the palette in the native format of the program *.AIGpal.

    Warning! After import (and before export) it's necessary to press the button "Save Palette"!!!

    For create your image is better to use specialized software. For instance, ImaGenesis.exe
    can edit the image so that it was right amount of color palettes - 15 color, 4bpp, 1 plane, 8x8 tiles.
    After this is only import the file *.bmp using a graphical editor for games sega in rom and change
    palette. Other programs - Genitile, B2T, GenRes, Mega-Happy-Sprite and other...

 The program is able to insert the intro in Rom approximately 80-90% of all existing Roms.
