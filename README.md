A Work-in-progress port of Touhou 1 - Highly Responsive to Prayers to the Sega Megadrive

(I'll get my ass sued by ZUN for this, won't I?)

A little project I started to learn coding for the MegaDrive.

The SGDK Devkit is required.

You can find it here https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK

Art assets must be remade from scratch (Because ZUN guidelines, and yes i know that logo.bmp still resembles the original title quite a lot
Ill take care of that eventually).
